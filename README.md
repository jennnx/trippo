# Trippo

This is the finished codebase for the Trippo project.

This project is part of the [Learnnext.ai](https://learnnext.ai) course.

### To get started

If you would simply like to run the app, clone this repo, and rename `.env.example` to `.env.local`. Next, make sure to replace the environment variables with actual production keys.
